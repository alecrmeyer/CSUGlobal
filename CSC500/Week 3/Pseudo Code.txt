Pseudo Code: 

Part 1:
	cost_of_food = user_input()
    tip = cost_of_food * tip_amount
    tax = cost_of_food * tax_amount
    total = cost_of_food + tip + tax
    output tip, tax and total

Part 2:
	current_time = user_input()
    alarm_time = user_input()
    total_time = current_time + alarm_time
    new_time = total_time % 24
	output new_time
