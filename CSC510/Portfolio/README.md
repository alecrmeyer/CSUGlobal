Instructions for execution:

1. Execute Portfolio_python.py as a Python script
2. Select option 1, 2 or 3 depending on desired input
    a. Option 1
        1. Enter a hand in the format: 
            l,l,r,c,a,i,i
    b. Option 2
        1. Program will automatically generate a random hand
    c. Option 3
        1. Exit the program
3. Observe the output displays the following components:
    Input Hand
    Logistic Regression Prediction
    Random Forest Prediction

    ANN + Expert System Prediction


You can verify the output using the following sample hands:
l,l,r,c,c,i,a - Keep
l,l,l,l,l,i,i - Mulligan
c,c,l,l,l,i,i - Keep
i,i,c,c,l,c,a - Mulligan
